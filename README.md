# BookHub
This app displays the list of popular books. You can see the full description of each book by click on any book.
You can also add a book to favorites and remove a book from favorites.
The app also has other screens such as a Developers Profile Page which tell you about the developer that made the app.
And an About App Page which tell you about the App.

Books are fetched from Server with the help of API.
This app has a feature to add books in Favorite, and remove from Favorite. For that, I used the Local Database for storing the data of books.
And, for handle all the database related operations, like store the data of book to the Favorites i.e. local database, or fetch the data, etc., SQLite is used.
